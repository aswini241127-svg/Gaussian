# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
2. prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
3. Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
4. program

## Program:
```

## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
